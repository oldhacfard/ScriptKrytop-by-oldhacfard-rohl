        <h2>📌 What is Reanimate?</h2>
        <p>
            Reanimate is a client-side character control system for Roblox that allows
            advanced animation handling, custom movement behaviors, and animation-based
            visual effects. It is commonly used for animation showcases and experimental
            gameplay mechanics.
